# YellowAnt marketplace

Let us take a look at[YellowAnt Marketplace](https://www.yellowant.com/marketplace/). The marketplace is designed to suit everyone. It consists of some generic apps like Wikipedia, RSS, and Stackexchange. It also contains Development tools like Github, Bitbucket and much more. Marketing personnel love our analytics integrations and managers are hooked to our CRM ones. Even people who are not using it for the workplace can use Twitter, Youtube, Evernote and Google Apps integrations. Then comes the applications by Google such as calendar, Gmail, contacts, drive. These all can be managed single-handedly by YellowAnt. Surprised? There is more to come.

Our team at YellowAnt is dedicated to providing you all the apps that are needed and are therefore working on integrating huge apps like Amazon Web Services, Salesforce, CircleCi, Sentry, AirBrake, NewRelic and the list goes on and on. There is always more integrations to build.
