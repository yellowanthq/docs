# Changing your email

* In the settings page, click on **Email**
* Enter your password and add a new email
* Click on **Save**

Note: If you are a Slack user, you will not be able to change your email here as the YellowAnt login occurs through OAuthentication. You can change your Slack email and that will be reflected in your YellowAnt account
