# Executing commands

Every application and crumb is comprised of commands and each command has a set of inputs which may or may not be necessary for the command. You can use YellowAnt in two modes

* **Commands** - Text commands in the format - &lt;app-name&gt; &lt;function&gt; &lt;argument-1&gt; &lt;value-1&gt; &lt;argument-n&gt; &lt;value-n&gt;
* **Dialogs **- Alternate interface where you simple type the application name and YellowAnt provides you with a convenient dialog with input boxes for the arguments.
