# Command Syntax

Our interface is completely designed to make our user experience a blissful one, so for any command you type, you will get suggestions how to proceed on with your command so that you will never have to learn our commands. How convenient!

But, if you love us so much and want to learn more about our product to be as efficient as possible, our YellowAnt has the most user-friendly commands and we say this with a sense of pride. This is because of our omnipresent command structure:

`'integration' 'function' 'key' ' "value" '`

For example:

`twitter tweet status "Hello World"`

Here we can easily relate that`twitter`is the_‘integration’_,`tweet`is the_‘function’_to perform,`status`is the_‘key’_and`"Hello World"`is the_‘ “value” ’_.  
And thats all you need to focus on! Simple?

There are commands which have more than one key and one value:

`'integration' 'function' ' key-1 ' ' "value-1" ' ' key-2 ' ' "value-2" ' ...... 'key-n' ' "value-n" '`

For example:

`github createissue repo "my-repo" title " my issue title" description "a description of the issue"`

The above command has 3 keys and 3 values. Here we can relate that  `github `is the  _integration_,`createissue`is the _function_,`repo `is the _key-1_, “my-repo” is the_“value-1”_,`title `is the _key-2_,`"my issue title"`is the _“ value-2”_,`description`is the _key-3 _and`"a description of the issue"`is the_“value-3”_.

All the integrations in YellowAnt have their own set of commands. You can learn how to use each one of them and their functions in our [Marketplace](https://www.yellowant.com/marketplace/) and click on any integration you want to know more about.

Hope that now we are on the same page as to how a command is structured in YellowAnt. Our intelligent bot is always there to assist you with commands and will even give suggestions to correct your commands if there is any error.
